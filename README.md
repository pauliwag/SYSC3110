***Authors and their contributions***

Jacob Laboissonniere
> Worked on inital game model classes (world, level, actor subclasses). Wrote USERMANUAL.md. Created GUI fxml file and GUIController class and integrated with existing model. Implemented undo/redo feature using serialization. Created Level Builder & Save/Load world feature. Number of small changes to clean up code. Playtesting.

<br>

Sameed Mohammed
> Worked on test classes for all classes in project, in particular for this iteration, worked on fixes for GUIController after updates, added test classes for all new Zombie types, and added thorough test classes for undo/redo features and save/load features. Added Javadoc comments to newly-made test classes. Added new utility methods to Level class that was utilized in testing of Milestone 4 features. Reviewed/edited design decision justification document.

<br>

Abdillahi Nur
>  Worked on porting project to android. Searched for and repaired bugs in program where applicable. Wrote the documentation file detailing our design decisions. Added Javadoc to methods.

<br>

Paul Roode
> UML class and sequence diagrams. Added new Zombie subtypes. Implemented TeleportingZombie logic and updated ActionProcessor::moveZombie accordingly. Added new zombie sprites for different terrains. Balanced the shipped levels. Implemented level reload logic. Implemented GUIController::notifyGameOver, World::addLevels, World::hasLevel. Refactored/de-smelled code. Playtested, debugged, failsafed. Contributed to README. Wrote *Refactoring the CooldownManager and World classes*, *Level reload logic* and *Data structs employed in zombie wave and spawn logic* sections of the *Design Decisions Justifications* document.

***A note about the UML sequence diagrams***

There are two sequence diagrams. Sequence diagram 1 features the sequences entailing:

1) launching and initializing the game
2) pushing a deep copy of the game world onto the undo stack via serialization
3) loading the GUI controller

Sequence diagram 2 features the sequences entailing:

4) selecting a plant type and placing it in a cell
5) undoing operation 4

***Changelog (v3.0 → 4.0)***

- new zombie types
- new level terrain types
- level builder feature added, can create/edit existing levels
- can now save/load world 
- can now create a new empty world
- can now load default world
- can now add existing level files to world
- plant selection GUI area made nicer
- CooldownManager is now a member of World

---

***User-visible changes***

- New terrain types on levels (grass, sand, ice)
- Can create and edit levels in GUI
- Plant selection GUI looks better
- Different zombie sprites depending on terrain type

---

***Known issues***

None.

---

***Performance***

There is a linear increase in memory usage if the *allow undo/redo* checkbox is selected. This is because we are storing a deep copy of the game world whenever it is changed. If playing on a computer with less than 4 GB of RAM, you may not want to use the undo/redo feature.
